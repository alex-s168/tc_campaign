NoC addresses consit of a X and a Y coordinate.
There are 5 NoC ports. 4 of them are to the sides of the router, and one is at the location of the router.
Your router has a configurable X and Y coordinate, which tells the router where it is, and where the 5th port is.
For routing packets, compare the current coordinate with the coordinate that the packet wants to go to.
Your router does not have to be instant.
All packets sent from one port into another port cannot be reordered!
You can block a NoC port if you need more time to route the packet.

Valid/Done interface:
 as long as done is false, valid and the data of that packet is set.
 when done is true, the next packet can be put onto the valid / done interface.

 (info, `Hint:
Most packets have to get routed in the same direction where they came from. Direction changes are more rare.`)]
